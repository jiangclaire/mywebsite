                        <p> This piece was done as a final project for the 2D Tools class. The assignment was to make a festival poster using PhotoShop, Illustrator, and InDesign. In addition, we had to use photo images, create a logo, and include a hierarchy of text as requirements of the assignment. I was inspired by Deadmau5 to create this festival poster. The image consists of a sunset background with the Deadmau5 logo glowing, and birds and a girl flying out of its mouth. I enjoyed this assignment as it challenged myself to use everything I've learned in this class from PhotoShop, Illustrator, and InDesign.

                            <p> "The Grilled Cheese House" is a menu I made for an InDesign assignment. The original menus I made were much more traditional, with straight lines and less shapes and colors. After getting a better handle on InDesign, I decided to have more fun with the assignment and played around with curvy positions of the text, adding in curvy shapes to mimic the curvy text, and added colors that gave the feeling of a grilled cheese sandwich.

                            <p> This was one of the first PhotoShop assignments we had. The idea was to take two opposites and layer them together, using opacity to play with how defined we wanted certain images versus others. I decided to choose cartoon versus reality, and used Bugs Bunny and real rabbits to illustrate these opposites. It was difficult deciding which images should be more opaque than others, but ultimately I decided to have Bugs Bunny be more opaque compared to the real rabbits to add a light comedic quality to the assignment.

                            <p> In this PhotoShop assignment, we again had to layer images on top of one another. This time however, the assignment was about making a scene of some sort and taking different elements of existing images, and editing and placing them into entirely new environments. I had an idea about putting something unnatural into something natural. I was inspired by snowglobes. Snowglobes have environments within them trapped in their own tiny bubble, completely unaffected by the outside world. I decided to create a sort of "Cosmic" snowglobe juxtaposed with a wintery, natural scene.
