                        <p> This was one of the earlier assignments in 2D Fundamentals. The objective was to create a piece in which only lines are used (can be thin or thick, create shapes, etc...). Our creation had to be inspired by a favorite song and somehow follow the flow of the music. We also had to focus on the concept of positive and negative space. What did we want the viewer to notice first? How did we want them to get there? I chose Machu Picchu by the Strokes as my inspiration and used mostly squares to show the progression of the song. All the lines point upwards, as my take on the flow of the song.

                        <p> The collage assignment was one of the last projects we had. We printed 8 to 10 images of textures and created 8 to 10 drawings that had the feeling of texture. My strategy going into this was to not make the drawings "perfect," in that textures are not perfect; depending on the texture (like carpet for instance), many do not have orderly objects and a defined set of things that will happen, like a pattern would. After we created our textures, we combined the images and hand drawn textures together to create a piece in which there's a clear direction from beginning to end.

                    <p> Before the individual collage assignment, we had a group collage project as well to get familiar and feel more comfortable with using textures. This was a collaborative piece in which we had to layer 3 different textures that we photographed on top of each other and drew the the texture forms. After we came up with a formation that we liked, and had them drawn with pencil, we painted them with black acrylic. This was quite a laborious piece as there were so many textures and shapes to paint on the large canvas. Sometimes the forms were not clear as they were layered with two other textures. In the end, we were satisfied with what we came up with and felt that the mesh between long wispy stripes, geometric shapes, and fur-like textures worked well together.

              <p>This was the last project in the 2D Fundamentals class. The assignment was to create a series of squares with the font of our choosing, paint them, and create a visually interesting piece by finding an arrangement that we felt worked. I found this one quite challenging, finding an arrangement of the letters was difficult; in addition, getting all the letters to fit onto the artboard was a challenge as well. In the end, I came up with an arrangement that I was satisfied with using a simple typeface. I quite liked the letterform “i” of this particular font as it reminded me visually of people, and when drawn on the same square, reminded me of individuals interacting with one another. </p>
